## Introduction

The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits using a deep learning neural network. We employ a simple yet effective neural network architecture and train it on the MNIST dataset to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a standard benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. It includes:

60,000 training images
10,000 test images
Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image of a handwritten digit.
