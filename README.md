# Insurance Claims Analysis

This repository contains data and analysis scripts for exploring and analyzing insurance claims data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about insurance claims, including details such as:

- PatientID: Unique identifier for each policyholder.
- age: Age of the policyholder.
- gender: Gender of the policyholder.
- bmi: Body mass index (BMI) of the policyholder.
- bloodpressure: Blood pressure of the policyholder.
- diabetic: Indicates whether the policyholder is diabetic (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- children: Number of children covered under the policy.
- smoker: Indicates whether the policyholder is a smoker (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- region: Geographic region of the policyholder.
- claim: Amount claimed by the policyholder.

The dataset is provided in CSV format and is stored in the `data/` directory.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involves the following steps:

1. Data Loading and Inspection: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and basic information such as the first few rows, summary statistics, and data types are inspected.

2. Data Cleaning: Data cleaning tasks may include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies in the data.

3. Data Visualization: Various visualizations are created to explore the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and uncover relationships between variables. Visualizations may include histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, box plots, etc.

4. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis may be performed to calculate summary statistics, test hypotheses, and identify significant factors affecting insurance claims.

## Analysis Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains Python scripts for performing the analysis. Each script focuses on a specific aspect of the analysis, such as data cleaning, visualization, or statistical analysis. The scripts are well-commented to explain the steps and methodologies used.

## Results

The `results/` directory may contain any reports, findings, or insights generated from the analysis. This could include summary statistics, visualizations, or conclusions drawn from the data.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the analysis scripts in the `scripts/` directory using Python.
4. Review the results and findings to gain insights into the insurance claims data.
