# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

## 📚 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of wine using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The wine quality dataset includes various chemical properties of wine, and the goal is to classify the quality of wine based on these features.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- fixed_acidity
- volatile_acidity
- citric_acid
- residual_sugar
- chlorides
- free_sulfur_dioxide
- total_sulfur_dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol
- quality

The quality column is the target variable, representing the quality of the wine on a scale.

# 🚀 Usage

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and preprocess the features.

### Feature Engineering:
Engineer new features if necessary to improve model performance.

### Model Training and Evaluation:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the LDA model on the training set.
Evaluate the model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

### Model Interpretation:
Analyze the LDA model to understand the contribution of each feature to the classification.
